# Bootcamp: PHP task
---
## Task

* Please build a web-app with php (see step 2 of the bootcamp) with the functionality to CRUD shopping-lists. The shopping-lists should have an editable name, a created-date and an updated-date.
* Also each list should have within it the functionality to CRUD list-entries. Each list-entry has a name and the states "open" and "checked" - crossing off one entry sets it from open to checked. You can also turn it back to open.
* Different lists have different list-entries.
* Please don't worry about login-functionality for now.
